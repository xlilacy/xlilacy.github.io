Perfectionism is often seen as a virtue, but in creative work, it can be our greatest enemy. Here's why embracing imperfection might be the key to better work.

## The Perfectionism Trap

Common signs of perfectionism:

Imperfect work often has:

   - Genuine voice
   - Unique perspective

2. **Better Connection**
   - Relatable content
   - Human touch
   - Emotional resonance

3. **Greater Growth**
   - Learning opportunities
   - Room for improvement
   - Creative evolution
