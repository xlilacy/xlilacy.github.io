For the past six months, I've been practicing what Julia Cameron calls "Morning Pages" — three pages of longhand, stream-of-consciousness writing done first thing in the morning. Here's what I've learned.

## The Practice

The rules are simple:
- Write three pages every morning
- Do it before anything else
- Write whatever comes to mind
- No editing, no stopping

## The Benefits

I've noticed several unexpected benefits:

1. **Mental Clarity**
   - Reduced anxiety
   - Better focus throughout the day
   - Clearer decision-making

2. **Creative Flow**
   - More ideas throughout the day
   - Easier access to creativity
   - Reduced writer's block

3. **Personal Growth**
   - Better self-understanding
   - Improved problem-solving
   - Stronger intuition

## The Challenges

Of course, it hasn't been all smooth sailing:

- Finding time every morning
- Maintaining consistency
- Dealing with resistance
- Overcoming perfectionism

## Tips for Success

If you want to try Morning Pages, here's what worked for me:

- Keep your notebook by your bed
- Set a consistent time
- Don't judge what you write
- Make it a non-negotiable part of your routine

## The Results

After six months, I can confidently say that Morning Pages have become an essential part of my creative practice. They've helped me:

- Develop a stronger writing habit
- Access deeper creative resources
- Maintain better mental health
- Stay connected to my authentic voice

The practice has taught me that sometimes the most powerful creative tools are the simplest ones.
