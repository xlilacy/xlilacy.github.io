Paradoxically, constraints often lead to our most creative work. When we're forced to work within limits, we find innovative solutions we might never have discovered otherwise.

## Why Constraints Help

Constraints:

- Focus our attention
- Force innovation
- Reduce overwhelm
- Create structure
- Spark creativity

## Types of Creative Constraints

1. **Time Constraints**
   - Writing sprints
   - Daily challenges
   - Time limits
   - Deadlines
   - Pomodoro technique

2. **Form Constraints**
   - Word limits
   - Specific formats
   - Style guides
   - Genre rules
   - Structure requirements

3. **Resource Constraints**
   - Limited tools
   - Basic materials
   - Simple technology
   - Minimal space
   - Restricted budget

> "The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self." â€” Igor Stravinsky

## Implementing Constraints
